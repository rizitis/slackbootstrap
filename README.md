Easily create Slackware chroot jail for testing and development SlackBuilds.
Its for Stable 64 bits and Current. Inspired by debootstrap.

## Why?
I use Slackware current, but as a SlackBuilds maintainer, i need to have Slackware stable installed to maintain the scripts in a clean environment.
Using Virtualization is a simple plan, but for compilation and testing it ends up making the environment "slower" even with KVM.
So this program does what I need, it creates a jailed environment, completely clean of 64-bit Slackware (Current or Stable).
